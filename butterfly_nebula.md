# Butterfly Nebula Engraving

Not fully laid out yet, but here are the basics:
1. Laser engrave the negatives to get preliminary texture
2. Use color segmentation to get bitmaps of the differently colored sections of the nebula, then make stencils
3. Get creative with the circle of stars
4. Maybe use colored pencils or something basic to add color?
5. Figure out contouring to give the nebula some texture (do multiple passes over just the main, ignore the lines/cracks?)
